        <section>
            At Mzalas Kota, we believe a kota is more than just a meal – it’s a taste of home, friendship, and good vibes.
            We started with one simple idea: to serve fresh, affordable, and mouth-watering kotas that bring people together. From school kids grabbing a quick lunch to families sharing a hearty bite, our kotas are made for everyone.
